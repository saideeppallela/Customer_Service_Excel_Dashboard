🌟Now, let me share the key components of my Customer Satisfaction Dashboard :-

1. Agent Performance: We use a chart to see how well each agent is satisfying customers. This helps us identify our top performers and areas where we can do better.
2. Workload Management: Another chart shows how many interactions each agent handles. This helps us manage workloads and spot agents with high customer engagement.
3. Contact Type Analysis: We have a pie chart that shows how customers reach out to us. This helps us understand the most common ways customers engage with our service.
4. Customer Satisfaction by Contact Type: Using a bar chart, we see how satisfied customers are with each contact type. This helps us prioritize improvements based on their impact on customer experience.
5. Daily Satisfaction Trends:With slicers and a line chart, we can filter and analyze daily customer satisfaction trends. This helps us spot patterns and issues quickly.
6. Daily Interaction Tracking: Another chart powered by slicers shows daily customer interactions. This helps us identify peak days and times when customers engage with us the most.

🗣️ With this dashboard, we get a complete view of customer satisfaction and interactions, helping us make informed decisions to improve the overall customer experience.
